# Christian Kaisermann

I'm a Web Engineer with over a decade of experience, passionate about open-source, developer tooling, and crafting scalable front-end architectures. Currently, I work at Circuit Routing, enhancing the last-mile delivery experience by improving our front-end infrastructure and developer experience. I have a strong background in TypeScript, Svelte, React, and CSS, and I'm an advocate for clean, maintainable code. Beyond work, I'm a contributor to the Svelte ecosystem and the author of several open-source libraries. I thrive in collaborative environments and love sharing knowledge through mentorship and open-source contributions.

### Skills

I'm familiar with most current industry tooling and framework choices such as _TypeScript_, _React_, _Svelte_, module bundlers (_Webpack_, _Rollup_, _Parcel_), _GraphQL_, and the great majority of _HTML_ and _CSS_ pre/post-processors. I'm also an advocate for readable, clean code and show it through my constant efforts of standardizing coding styles and knowledge sharing.

My peers usually think I'm easy-going, communicative, a fast learner, and a reference for CSS and JavaScript knowledge. I'm also familiar with agile methodologies, interviewing, and managing open-source projects and small communities.
